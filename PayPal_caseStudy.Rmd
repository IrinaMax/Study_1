## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
pp <- read.csv('/Users/irinamax/Documents/R/Experiments/vendor_case_study_updated/pp_cust_data.csv')
pp %>% head
pp %>% dim       # Data has 2172 rows and 3 col
pp %>% str       # active_send and active_receive has binary structure
pp %>% summary   # but different mean, where we can see senders more active
sum(is.na(pp))   # not missing value

#How many active users in PP list who buying and selling
pp_a<- pp %>%  filter((active_send %in% 1), (active_receive %in% 1))
pp_a %>% head(10)
pp_a %>% dim  ##  here is 832  active used in the PP list

# How many not active?
pp_ch<- pp %>%  filter((active_send %in% 0), (active_receive %in% 0))
pp_ch %>% head(10)
pp_ch %>% dim   # 254 unactive users, or I would call them churned

# ratio in PP list is 254/832 = 0.3052885
paste("Ratio of Churn users in pp table during last year: ", length( pp_ch[,1])/length(pp_a[,1]))
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
